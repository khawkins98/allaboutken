# {{title}} <small>aka, my longer resume</small>

<p class="">My career and interests revolve on common points: distillation of unorganised information into clearer communication.</p>

<!-- I've found this challenge a recurrent and beneficial problem to solve in newspaper reporting, e-commerce, corporate websites and often in things as simple as a rather messy brochure. Below I've attempted to show how my various work experience (left) equates to major areas of my knowledge (right), and I've added a few key lenses in the middle. -->

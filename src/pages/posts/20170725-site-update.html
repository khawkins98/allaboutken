<p class="lead">As is apt for us web types, on [25 July 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170801000000*/allaboutken.com) I gave a reboot to my professional website.</p>

Why? The content was slightly outdated and I was keen to move it from a Drupal-powered site to a Gulp powered site.

Why move from Drupal to Gulp when I'm just working with simple content? Well, why not? 😁

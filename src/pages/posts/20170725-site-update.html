<p class="lead">As is apt for us web types, on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625193445/http://allaboutken.com/">25 July 2017</a> I gave a reboot to this website.</p>

Why? The content was slightly outdated and I was keen to move it from a Drupal-powered site to a Gulp powered site.

Why move from Drupal to a static site when I'm just working with simple content? That's exactly why.

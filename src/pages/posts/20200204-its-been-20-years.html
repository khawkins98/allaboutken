A clearout turned up a folder stuffed with clips from my years working at newspapers; and with it the realisation I've been doing publishing for 20 years &mdash; my first first newspaper gig was in January 2000. 

<!--I will resist reciting my career (for that [you can visit my CV page](https://work.allaboutken.com/cv/)), but I'll induldge in a little bit of reflection.-->

How different things seem now.

The seemingly most obvious change has been technology and speed. Partly that’s from a career that’s moved away from infographics for print-focused newspapers ([example]({{root}}images/original/blog/20years-house-move.pdf)) to digital publishing. 

Technology changes have been tremendous — so much so you’d think it was _the_ change.

My daily software in 2000 was Quark 4 on Mac OS 7. For those who didn’t use it or have forgotten, it looked like: 

<div class="grid-x">

  <figcaption>I don’t think there's anything about QuarkXPress 4 on Mac OS 7 to be nostalgic for, other than the lack of real multi-tasking and fragility of the environment meant that you stayed focused on the task. No switching out for a bit of quick website reading, unless you wanted the whole system to reboot. <a href="http://main.system7today.com/software/quark/screenshot.html">Source: System7Today</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

Fancier things like Quark 5 and Adobe's [controversial](https://www.macworld.com/article/1013910/quarkvsindesign.html) InDesign were already shaking things up (did I ever want that optical kerning), but they were too new and simply weren’t trusted for our daily production needs and printing and waxing. 

<div class="grid-x">
<figure class="large-10 medium-8 cell callout">
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/CwrePe4-ID4?start=366' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
  <figcaption>Waxing nostalgic for the tactile processes: advertisements were literaly lifted and pasted across editions and typos from final proofs were cut and arranged away before being sent to the press cameras.</figcaption>

With improving technology the iteration cycles became much faster. Particularly in 2008 when I switched from working for newspapers to an online-only publication. 

## The siren call of the web

Those years in print publishing from 2000 through sometime in 2008 were filled with horrors of machine-locking system errors and lifting and re-waxing ads from yesterday’s edition. But despite the instantaniousness of the web, it had its own horrors.

Fortunately, I won’t have to retell it all, with serendipitous timing, developer Evelyn Woods has just written [a retrospective on the CSS and the web dating from a similar time period](https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/), in part:

> I&#8217;ve been taking for granted that <em>most</em> folks doing web stuff still remember those days, or at least the decade that followed, but I think that assumption might be a wee bit out of date.  Some time ago I encountered a <a href="https://twitter.com/keinegurke_/status/1162309192855822339">tweet</a> marvelling at what we had to do without <code>border-radius</code>. 
> I&#8217;m here to tell <em>all</em> of you to get off my lawn.  Here&#8217;s a history of <span class="caps">CSS</span> and web design, as I remember&nbsp;it.

New and incredible features were coming all the time (oh how Firebug was magical), but there were so few established best practices and fewer people to get good advice from. The software wasn't always pointing you in the best direction either. 

Why use code templating and partials when you could use Dreamweaver's library and export hundreds of pages in Word-like interface! It was only error prone and rediculously slow.

If I never have to upload a site by FTP again, it will be too soon. 

<figure class="large-10 medium-8 cell callout"><img class="padding-bottom-medium" alt="Tightly pairing Fractal and Eleventy can be done" src="{{root}}images/original/blog/20years-dreamweaver.jpg" />
  <figcaption>[Informit guide to Dreamweaver MX 2004](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=355342&seqNum=8) The legendary Dreamweaver and the horrors that designing web pages like documents unleashes -- there were far worse options and the product did a lot of impressive things, but I still wonder if it would have been better to never tried to use a graphical code editor, for a decade it stunted my understanding of where the web was going.</figcaption>
</figure>

I have nostalgia for the process of print publishing in the early 2000s, I don’t have that for websites of the same period. Sure, there was the novelty of your first few small websites -- but beyond a few pages, the horrors of Dreamweaver, cgi-bin, proprietary browser features and all the things Woods mentions lay in wait. 

Digital was chaos, at least print had organisational processes to learn from.

## Where's this tech going?

I can produce vastly more _stuff_ in 24 hours than I could 20 years ago, but producing good things has gotten any easier.

And from the early-mid 2000s it’s all changed, tech wise anyways. The web still has issues but the tools are mature and generally reliable. But real problems remain very human problems: agreeing on goals, setting expectations, motivating teams. 

From the start of my career my resume has always been focused on my technical ability, but I view that with increasingly less interest. These days it’s so rarely about building the thing, but instead about aligning people on the same goals. 

And all to often you can’t get agreement on the most basic of things: what are we trying to achieve here?

I still don’t know how to describe what I do, web and information acrobat is probably the closest I’ve come. I bet recruitment systems will love that.

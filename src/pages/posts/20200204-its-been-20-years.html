A clearout turned up a folder stuffed with clips from my years working at newspapers; and with it the realisation I've been doing publishing for 20 years &mdash; my first first newspaper gig was in January 2000. 

<!--I will resist reciting my career (for that [you can visit my CV page](https://work.allaboutken.com/cv/)), but I'll indulge in a little bit of reflection.-->

How different things seem now.

The seemingly most obvious change has been technology and speed. Partly that’s from a career that’s moved away from infographics for print-focused newspapers ([example]({{root}}images/original/blog/20years-house-move.pdf)) to digital publishing. 

Technology changes have been tremendous — so much so you’d think it was _the_ change.

My daily software in 2000 was Quark 4 on Mac OS 7. I don’t think there's anything about that duo to be nostalgic for, other than the lack of real multi-tasking and fragility of the environment meant that you stayed focused on the task. No switching out for a bit of quick website reading, unless you wanted the whole system to reboot.

You were always one bad PostScript ad placement away from a system lock and losing 30 minutes of work.

Fancier things like Quark 5 and Adobe's [controversial](https://www.macworld.com/article/1013910/quarkvsindesign.html) InDesign were already shaking things up (did I ever want that optical kerning), but they were too new and simply weren’t trusted for our daily production needs and printing and waxing.

With improving technology the iteration cycles became much faster. Particularly in 2008 when I switched from working for newspapers to an online-only publication.

Speed and features were everything we needed, at least it felt that way.

## The siren call of the early web tools

Although my years in print publishing from through 2008 were filled machine-locking system errors and lifting and re-waxing ads from yesterday’s edition, the web had its own horrors waiting behind a veneer of instant publishing.

The acronym WYSIWYG still haunts web publishing in 2020.

<figure class="large-10 medium-8 cell callout"><img class="padding-bottom-medium" alt="Tightly pairing Fractal and Eleventy can be done" src="{{root}}images/original/blog/20years-dreamweaver-2.jpg" />
  <figcaption>Dreamweaver allowed you to build website like QuarkXPress documents. Fine if the web were a book. For a decade it stunted my understanding of where the web was going and it was a compromise between visual and code that often granted the worst of both worlds.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you designed print documents you know the importance of using your document styles to manage text properties and images, however it was a concept that didn't really exist for the web until CSS arrived in 1996 and it took CSS some time to go from managing styling to empowering layout. Internet Explorer would dominate and we would have to wait until mid-2000s for meaningful CSS innovations to arrive. 

It was a rough time.

Fortunately, I won’t have to retell it all, with serendipitous timing, developer Evelyn Woods has just written [a retrospective on the CSS and the web dating from a similar time period](https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/), in part:

> I&#8217;ve been taking for granted that <em>most</em> folks doing web stuff still remember those days, or at least the decade that followed, but I think that assumption might be a wee bit out of date.  Some time ago I encountered a <a href="https://twitter.com/keinegurke_/status/1162309192855822339">tweet</a> marvelling at what we had to do without <code>border-radius</code>. 
>
> I&#8217;m here to tell <em>all</em> of you to get off my lawn.  Here&#8217;s a history of <span class="caps">CSS</span> and web design, as I remember it.

New and incredible features were coming all the time (oh how [Firebug](https://getfirebug.com/) was magical), but there were so few established best practices and fewer people to get good advice from. And software didn't always point you in the best direction. 

Why use code templating and partials? Use Dreamweaver's library and export hundreds of pages in Word-like interface! ... It will only be error prone and ridiculously slow.

  <figure class="large-12 medium-8 cell callout"><img class="padding-bottom-medium" alt="Tightly pairing Fractal and Eleventy can be done" src="{{root}}images/original/blog/20years-rebuilding-envmedia.gif" />
    <figcaption>Dreamweaver was a (slow) static site generator before they were the hotness, but it was also a WYSIWYG, FTP client and pretty much everything else. A real <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none">jack of all trades</a>. </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

The tools and their developers did their best to fill the gaps, but if I never have to upload a site by FTP again, it will be too soon. 

I have nostalgia for the process of print publishing, I don’t have that for websites of the same period. Sure, there was the novelty of your first few small websites &mdash; but beyond a few pages, the horrors of WYSIWYG, cgi-bin, proprietary browser features and all the things Woods mentions lay in wait. 

Digital was chaos of new-ness, at least print had 100s of years of processes to learn from.

## How do we do better?

From the early-mid 2000s the tools are vastly better. They amplify our ability to produce far more _stuff_ in 24 hours, but they don't help us ensure we're going in the right direction. 

Producing the _right stuff_ is no easier than it was for the web in 2004 or for print. 

<!-- Twice as much of the wrong answer doesn't help anyone.  -->

<!--The web still has issues but tools are mature and generally reliable and delivery is fast.-->


<!--To do good work, the real problem remains very human: agreeing on goals, setting expectations, motivating teams.--> 

<!--From the start of my career I've focused on technical ability, but I view that with increasingly less interest. Better to have slower production of the right answer.-->

Thanks to better tools we can take our time savings and refocus on the fundamental and universal hard problem: what are we trying to achieve here?

<!-- I still don’t know how to describe what I do, web and information acrobat is probably the closest I’ve come. I bet recruitment systems will love that. -->

    <figcaption>Thanks to the Wayback Machine miracle, we can enjoy [this snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20020120145620/http://envmedia.com/) of one of my more profound early websites: a website for the video company Environmental Media. The site had search, Flash video clips and an online shop with a shopping basket and checkout, way back in 2001! Quite a feat for young me.</figcaption>

A chance clearout of old receipts turned up a folder stuffed with clips from my years working at newspapers; and with it the recollection that my first first gig at a newspaper was now 20 years ago, starting in January 2000. 

<!--I will resist reciting my career (for that [you can visit my CV page](https://work.allaboutken.com/cv/)), but I'll induldge in a little bit of reflection.-->

How different things seem now.

The seemingly most obvious change has been technology and speed. Partly that’s from a career that’s moved away from print-focused newspapers to digital publishing. Changes in software have been tremendous. So much so you’d think it was _the_ change.

My daily software in 2000 was Quark 4 on Mac OS 7. For those who didn’t use it or have forgotten, it looked like: 

<figure class="large-10 medium-8 cell callout"><img class="padding-bottom-medium" alt="Tightly pairing Fractal and Eleventy can be done" src="{{root}}images/original/blog/20years-quark.jpg" />
  <figcaption>[http://main.system7today.com/software/quark/screenshot.html] -- I don’t think there's anything about QuarkXPress 4 on Mac OS 7 to be nostalgic for, other than the lack of real multi-tasking and fragility of the environment meant that you stayed focused on the task. No switching out for a bit of quick website reading, unless you wanted the whole system to reboot.</figcaption>

Fancier things like Quark 5 and Adobe's [controversial](https://www.macworld.com/article/1013910/quarkvsindesign.html) InDesign were already shaking things up (did I ever want that optical kerning), but they simply weren’t trusted for our daily production needs and printing and waxing.

With improving technology the iteration cycles have become much faster. Particularly having switched from working for newspapers where we still waited on physical proofs printed on the real printing press before calling it a night. 

I can produce vastly more _stuff_ in 24 hours than I could 20 years ago, but I don’t think the change in tech has made producing good things any easier.

Those years from 2000 through sometime in 2008 were filled with horrors of machine-locking system errors and lifting and re-waxing ads from yesterday’s edition. Equally when I wasn’t producing layouts for print, the web was still horrific.

Fortunately, I won’t have to retell the horrors of those early days, with serendipitous timing, developer Evelyn Woods has just written [a retrospective on the web dating from a similar time period](https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/).

  <figcaption>[Informit guide to Dreamweaver MX 2004](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=355342&seqNum=8) The legendary Dreamweaver and the horrors that designing web pages like documents unleashes -- there were far worse options and the product did a lot of impressive things, but I still wonder if it would have been better to never tried to use a graphical code editor, for a decade it stunted my understanding of where the web was going.</figcaption>
</figure>


I have nostalgia for the process of page layout in the early 2000s, I don’t have that for websites of the same period. Sure, there was the novelty of your first few small sites -- but beyond a few pages, the horrors of Dreamweaver, cgi-bin, proprietary browser features and all the things Woods mentions lay in wait. 

And from the early 2000s it’s all changed, tech wise anyways. The web still has issues but the tools are mature and generally reliable. But real problems remain very human problems: agreeing on goals, setting expectations, motivating teams. 

From the start of my career my resume has always been focused on my technical ability, but I view that with increasingly less interest. These days it’s so rarely about building the thing, but instead about aligning people on the same goals. 

And all to often you can’t get agreement on the most basic of things: what are we trying to achieve here?

I still don’t know how to describe what I do, web and information acrobat is probably the closest I’ve come. I bet recruitment systems will love that.
